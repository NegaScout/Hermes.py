# Hermes.py

This discord bot aims to act as a middle man for game server deployment.

Vision of what the bot will be able to do:
- Register users to VPN with discord modals, so there is no need for port forwarding, if game server node is hosted behind a nat
- Deploy game server instances, either localy on hosting server or at cloud
- Show status of managed servers
- Start, stop, restart or reload servers
- Act as ansible runner (game server nodes will be managed by ansible)
- Upload custom maps?
- Mod managment?
